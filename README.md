# Smart-Cane-for-Blind-Poeple
design and implementation of a smart device to solve and simplify the problem of identifying obstacles using sensors and computer vision solutions.

# Abstract

The purpose of this project is to solve the difficulty of blind people in moving from one place to 
another place and simplify their day to day activities. As we all know most blind people depend on 
other people’s guidance and a hand held stick to avoid obstacles and walk outside. In this project we 
design  and  implement  a  smart  device  to  solve  and  simplify  the  problem  of  identifying  obstacles 
using sensors and computer vision solutions. 
This device will include proximity sensors to sense the distance from obstacles, light sensors to sense 
the light conditions of the environment, moisture sensor to sense water, USB web cam and raspberry 
pi  to  achieve  the  desired  goal.  All  the  data  gathered  by  the  sensors  and  the  camera  is  fed  to  the 
raspberry pi in order to get processed inform the user. It will also include a buzzer to notify the user 
that an obstacle has been detected. The device will benefit visually impaired poeople  navigate to 
any place without the need of other people’s guidance
